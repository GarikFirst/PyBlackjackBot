# PyBlackjackBot Blackjack bot for Telegram

Simple telegram bot on python3 with inline keyboards and user scoreboard. 

This bot uses the [python telegram bot](https://python-telegram-bot.org) framework to make Telegram API calls.

My goal was to test the possibility of creating a telegram bot that does not send messages to the user, but only edits ones that it has previously sent in addition with using inline keyboards.

You can see this bot in action here: https://t.me/blackjack_gamebot.

## Installation

### Install 

It's really simple just do following steps to run from source (you need python3 & token from your bot), you need to specify your _bot token_ in config file.
1. `git clone https://github.com/GarikFirst/PyBlackjackBot.git` - clone this repo.

3. specify your bot _token_ in **token** key in `config.json`.
4. specify your bot _user id_ in **bot_owner** tag in `config.json`, if you'd like to use secret commands.

2. go and check your bot in Telegram client by sending /start

## Secret commands

This bot has several secret command, wich can be sent to bot by owner and help you get some info about playes current activities. Just make shure you specify your _user id_ in config earlier on installation steps.

- `/logs n` (n can be ommited) - return n lines from logfile, if n is ommited, than **log_length** from config file number of lines
